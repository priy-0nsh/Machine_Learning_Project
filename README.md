## Improving agricultural productivity by applying Machine Learning on Farming Data

<p>
This project demonstrates how machine learning can play a vital role in modern agriculture by
accurately predicting crop yields using environmental and soil-based parameters. By integrating
multiple datasets and experimenting with various regression models, we were able to identify the
strengths and limitations of different algorithms in capturing the complex relationships between
factors like soil nutrients, rainfall, and fertilizer use.</p>
<p>
We have also confirmed that Tree based models give the best prediction with Random Forest
Regressor with the lowest bias
Overall, this project not only improved our understanding of machine learning applications in
agriculture but also highlighted how data-driven insights can support farmers and policymakers in
making more informed, efficient, and sustainable decisions
